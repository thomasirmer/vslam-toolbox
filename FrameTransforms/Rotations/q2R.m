function [R,Rq] = q2R(q)

% Q2R  Quaternion to rotation matrix conversion.
%   R = Q2R(Q) builds the rotation matrix corresponding to the unit
%   quaternion Q. The obtained matrix R is such that the product:
%
%        rg = R * rb 
%
%   converts the body referenced vector  rb 
%     into the global referenced vector  rg
%
%   [R,Rq] = (...) returns the Jacobian wrt q.
%
%   See also QUATERNION, R2Q, Q2E, Q2V.
