function [t,q,R,Rt,Pi,Pc] = splitFrame(F)

% SPLITFRAME  Split frame information into useful matrices and vectors.
%   [T,Q,R,Rt] = SPLITFRAME(F), for a frame F, returns the translation
%   vector T, quaternion Q, rotation matrix R and its transpose Rt. The
%   frame F can be either a 7-vector F=[T;Q] or a structure containing, at
%   least, the fields F.t, F.q, F.R and F.Rt.
%
%   [T,Q,R,Rt,Pi,Pc] = SPLITFRAME(F) returns in addition the Pi matrix and
%   its conjugate Pc. See fromFrame and toFrame for explanations on
%   matrices Pi and Pc. If F is a frame structure, it needs to contain the
%   fields F.Pi and F.Pc.
%
%   See also FRAME, UPDATEFRAME.
