II. Installation and quick usage.
=================================
To make it work, start Matlab and follow these steps:

1. Let us call the toolbox path %SLAM. From the Matlab prompt, > cd  %SLAM/

2. Add all subdirectories in %SLAM/ to your Matlab path.

3. Edit file userData.m and enter the data of your experiment.

4. Run slamtb.m.

5. To develop methods, read first slamToolbox.pdf and guidelines.pdf.

Enjoy!
